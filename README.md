# OpenPrinterTestPages
Basically Free Test Pages for your Printer.
No Watermarks, no blocky JPEGs, no hassle. Ranging from Calibration to Colour and Tint Levels.
Maybe even Language.

Feel free to contribute yourself if you want to. It doesn't even have to be similar.
Everyone's printer is different, and so is the way they test it.

Feel free to share yours. Be sure to contribute a PNG to accompany the SVG you post.
